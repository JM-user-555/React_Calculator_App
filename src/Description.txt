Hello, it's Jad Mattar. This is a description file of the project.

In this project, I used react.js to build a calculator. We can perform multiple operations like addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, power and radical. 
You can also continue your calculations by taking the result directly as number 1.

We have defined for each button a function that we run once this button is pressed.
For the digits, it will just add the number by multiplying by 10 and adding the digit.
For operators, it will set the operator based on the button pressed.
For the equal button, eventually, it will check what the operator is and will perform the operation between number 1 and number 2 accordingly. 
The C button will clear the numbers and result. The button Del will delete the last digit entered.

Moreover, I added the quadratic equation solver, in which the user enters the 3 parameters a, b, and c and the solution is displayed based of the equations of solving quadratic equations.
